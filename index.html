                    "I actually switch between an Intuos 4 and a Cintiq 24HD at the moment. Although the Cintiq is amazing,
                     I try to force myself to draw with my normal tablet from time to time, since it can be pretty weird to 
                     switch back to a normal tablet after adapting to the Cintiq but I don’t want to fall out of practice! 
                     Sometimes, when I’m working on location for a client, my only choice is to take a normal tablet with me 
                     since it’s basically impossible to casually transport a Cintiq (it weighs like 30 kilos). So I need to 
                     make sure I can still handle the normal tablet for professional reasons!"
