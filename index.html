<h1> Nick Hoult Fanpage </h1>

<p>Nick Hoult (尼克 · 霍尔特, Níkè · huò ěr tè), the older half-brother of Neil Bowman, 
    is one of the main characters of the All Saints Street manhua and donghua series.

    Nick is a demon with long red horns, which curl back in the middle, and a long red tail 
    with an arrowhead tip. Like other demons, he has goat-like ears. His hair is a semi-long mullet, 
    chiefly kept tied back in a braid, and his eyes are golden, the same colour as his half-brother
     Neil's. He also has a small amount of stubble on the chin.
